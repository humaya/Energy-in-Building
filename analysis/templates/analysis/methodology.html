Since the time series need to be complete, the missing data are add to the list using the average of last 2 hours. <br>
A set of daily data created using the average of temperatures and energy consumption for each day in order to have suitable data set for regression. <br>

                    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="linear-regression">Typical method of defining a base line for energy consumption in building is linear regression. <br>
Considering this case as Multivariate Time Series, linear regression can be defined by energy consumption as the function of " Heating Degree Day (HDD) = T_setpoint â€“ T_outside"  and "Delta Temperature (DT)= T_setpoint-T_inside"

                        SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification (SVC) or regression (SVR) problems. It uses a technique called the "kernel trick" to transform the data and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs. <br>
In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known member is the support vector machine (SVM). <br>
                        The method of Support Vector Classification can be extended to solve regression problems by different methods: <br> 1- Radial basis function kernel (RBF)<br> 2- Linear SVR<br> 3- Polynomial SVR
